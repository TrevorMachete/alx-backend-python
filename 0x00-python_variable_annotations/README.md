# 0x00. Python - Variable Annotations

This project includes several tasks that demonstrate the use of variable annotations in Python.

## Tasks

### 0. Basic annotations - add
A type-annotated function `add` that takes a float `a` and a float `b` as arguments and returns their sum as a float.

### 1. Basic annotations - concat
TBD

### 2. Basic annotations - floor
A type-annotated function `floor` which takes a float `n` as argument and returns the floor of the float.

### 3. Basic annotations - to string
A type-annotated function `to_str` that takes a float `n` as argument and returns the string representation of the float.

### 4. Define variables
Define and annotate the following variables with the specified values:
- `a`, an integer with a value of 1
- `pi`, a float with a value of 3.14
- `i_understand_annotations`, a boolean with a value of True
- `school`, a string with a value of “Holberton”

### 5. Complex types - list of floats
A type-annotated function `sum_list` which takes a list `input_list` of floats as argument and returns their sum as a float.

### 6. Complex types - mixed list
A type-annotated function `sum_mixed_list` which takes a list `mxd_lst` of integers and floats and returns their sum as a float.

### 7. Complex types - string and int/float to tuple
A type-annotated function `to_kv` that takes a string `k` and an int OR float `v` as arguments and returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the string `k`. The second element is the square of the int/float `v` and should be annotated as a float.

### 8. Complex types - functions
A type-annotated function `make_multiplier` that takes a float `multiplier` as argument and returns a function that multiplies a float by `multiplier`.

### 9. Let's duck type an iterable object
Annotate the below function’s parameters and return values with the appropriate types.

### 10. Duck typing - first element of a sequence
Augment the following code with the correct duck-typed annotations.

### 11. More involved type annotations
Given the parameters and the return values, add type annotations to the function.

### 12. Type Checking
Use mypy to validate the following piece of code and apply any necessary changes.
